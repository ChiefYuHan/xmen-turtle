{"concept_id": "C1512322", "aliases": ["Stress Induction of HSP Regulation"], "types": ["T043"], "canonical_name": "HSP27 Regulation Pathway", "definition": "Mammalian cells can respond to a variety of stresses such as heat, cold, oxidative stress, metabolic disturbance, and environmental toxins through necrotic or apoptotic cell death, while increased expression and phosphorylation of heat shock proteins such as Hsp27 can protect cells against cellular stress. Heat shock proteins commonly exhibit molecular chaperone activity and also interact with a wide variety of proteins to exert specific effects. The small heat shock protein Hsp27 exists as monomers, dimers, and oligomers in the cell, and each form has distinct activities. Oligomers are the main form of Hsp27 with molecular chaperone activity and are disrupted by phosphorylation of Hsp27 to form dimers and monomers. S-thiolation of Hsp27 on cysteine also dissociates oligomers and may provide another route of regulating the action of Hsp27 in stress. Map kinase cascades mediate Hsp27 phosphorylation. Heat stress activates the p38 kinase cascade and induces phosphorylation of Hsp27 by the downstream Map kinases Mapkapk2 and Mapkap3. Cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 can also induce Hsp27 phosphorylation through this Map kinase cascade, protecting cells in some settings against cytotoxic responses. In stressful conditions, dissociation of oligomeric Hsp27 by phosphorylation may allow lower molecular weight forms to perform other non-chaperone functions. One action of Hsp27 induced by stress is to protect cells against apoptosis and a common component of apoptotic pathways is the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. One way that Hsp27 reduces apoptosis is by preventing the release of cytochrome c and by binding to cytochrome c in the cytosol. Downstream, Hsp27 also blocks caspase 9 activation and the subsequent activation of caspase 3, inhibiting the rest of the proteolytic caspase cascade. Yet a further role of Hsp27 in blocking apoptosis is through blocking Fas-induced apoptosis. Fas is a receptor in the TNF receptor gene family that induces apoptosis when stimulated by its cell-bound ligand, Fas-ligand. Fas induces apoptosis through two pathways, one mediated by the protein Daxx. Phosphorylated Hsp27 dimers block apoptosis by binding with Daxx and preventing downstream activation of the kinase Ask1. The interaction of Hsp27 with actin filaments may also prevent apoptosis triggered by some agents like staurosporine that damage actin. Unphosphorylated Hsp27 monomers regulate actin filament growth by binding to the end of fibers and capping them. Finally, Hsp27 appears to prevent damage to cells by reactive oxygen species (ROS), by altering the oxidative environment of the cell through induction of glutathione expression, as well as blocking apoptosis induced by ROS. Modulation of Hsp27 expression and phosphorylation may provide a useful means to alter cellular sensitivity to stress. (This definition may be outdated - see the DesignNote.)"}

Theraflu preparations are used to relieve symptoms of cold and flu. Acetaminophen exerts its actions by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. The antihistamines block the effects of histamine. Dextromethorphan exerts its activity by raising the threshold for coughing in the cough center. The decongestants are sympathomimetic agents that cause vasoconstriction mediated through alpha-adrenergic receptors. This reduces blood flow, decreases swelling and prevents nasal and sinus congestion."}
{"concept_id": "C1516799", "aliases": ["Electron Transport Reaction in Mitochondria"], "types": ["T044"], "canonical_name": "Electron Transport Pathway", "definition": "The body gets energy through the oxidation of food such as glucose and fatty acids. The chemical energy contained in these foods is extracted and converted until it reaches a common form, the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP is highly favorable and is coupled to a variety of energetically unfavorable processes to drive them forward. Most of the energy of glucose or fatty acids is extracted through oxidation to produce the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. From there, the energy is transferred next to the electron transport system associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This chain includes a series of protein complexes and non-membrane cofactors that transfer the electrons from NADH and FADH2 in a series of redox reactions from carrier to carrier. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the chain, resulting in the production of water. The oxygen we breathe, and which is transported by hemoglobin in the blood to all of the tissues, serves this purpose and allows electron transport to occur. As the electrons pass through the chain, they transfer their energy to the complexes, which use the energy to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix, creating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The chemical energy that started with glucose, and was transferred to NADH and FADH2, is then converted to the energy of a concentration gradient. The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to protons on its own, so the energy of the proton gradient is stable, waiting to be recaptured. The energy is recaptured by ATP synthase in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This enzyme allows protons to flow back down their concentration gradient across the membrane, and in the process uses the energy of the gradient to drive ATP synthesis. The movement of the electrons through electron transport, the proton gradient and ATP synthesis are all coupled processes that require each other to occur. The cell does not store energy as ATP, but only has enough ATP on hand for its immediate energy needs. If electron transport ceases or is inhibited, then ATP synthesis also rapidly halts. This regulation ensures that ATP production closely matches the needs of the cell. Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are also closely linked to the energy needs of the cell. The abundance of ATP, NADH and pathway intermediates regulates key steps in these pathways so that they are activated when energy is required to feed the electron transport system and they are inhibited when not needed to save metabolic energy. If oxygen is absent, electron transport and the Krebs cycle rapidly halt, leaving glycolysis and fermentation as the main means of energy production. During aerobic exercise, the rapid consumption of ATP leads to use of the proton gradient to make more ATP, increased electron transport to regenerate the proton gradient, increased oxygen consumption, and increased activity of the Krebs cycle and glycolysis to supply high energy electrons to drive electron transport. Uncoupling agents allow protons to flow across the mitochondrial membrane without producing ATP. The chemical compound dinitrophenol (DNP), for example, can transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane without ATP synthase. In the presence of dinitrophenol, energy is consumed to pump protons out of mitochondria, but this energy is not recaptured in chemical form in ATP. Instead, this energy is released as heat. Dinitrophenol was once used as diet remedy to lose weight without exercise or diet, but this compound is a metabolic poison and resulted in deaths in when purposefully given to humans. Proteins also can act as uncoupling agents in the mitochondria. A mitochondrial uncoupling protein is found in brown adipose tissue. An increase in the activity of uncoupling proteins increases heat production by allowing protons to flow down their gradient without making ATP and may serve as protection against cold, as well as a potential means of obesity control.

Human coronaviruses cause mild respiratory illness and account for about a third of all cases of the common cold. A novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of SARS and its genome has been sequenced. The enveloped SARS virus contains a large plus strand RNA genome, approximately 30,000 nucleotides. Examination of the SARS coronavirus sequences reveals that the rep gene covers over 20,000 nucleotides and encodes two overlapping polyproteins cleaved by viral proteases into smaller protein products. Translation of the longer polyprotein encoded by the rep gene requires a ribosomal frameshift. Other viral genes are predicted to encode the transmembrane spike protein S involved in viral fusion with host cells, the envelope protein E, the membrane protein M and the nucleocapsid protein N that binds to the RNA genome as well as several additional open reading frames with unknown functions. Viral entry into the cell is followed by translation of the viral rep gene, which codes for a viral protease within the polyprotein, Mpro or 3CLpro. The SARS 3CLpro has also been verified in vitro to cleave after the Gln residue at Leu-Gln-(Ser, Ala, Gly). Polypeptides released from the polyproteins by the main viral protease Mpro or 3CLpro include the viral polymerase and a protease. Both products are essential for viral replication and transcription. Structural crystals of a porcine coronavirus protease with a transition state inhibitor suggest that inhibitors of the distantly related rhinovirus protease like the drug AG7088 may be modified to produce drugs that block the SARS protease and viral replication. Blocking entry of the SARS virus into cells, involving recognition of cellular receptors by the S spike protein, may provide another strategy for the development of drugs to treat SARS.

The snare is introduced into the respiratory tract through the working channel of a bronchoscope (or directly through the nose); a mechanism at the proximal end (handle) controls how much wire extends out of the channel and the movement of the sliding cutting loop as the loop is withdrawn into the cannula. The snare loops (e.g., 0.5 and 1 inch/13 and 23 mm size) are made of monofilament or braided wires that are attached at the proximal end to an electrosurgical (usually monopolar) unit that provides circulation of radio-frequency electric current between the isolated metal loop (i.e., acting as an active electrode) and an external neutral electrode to heat the tissues and facilitate resection and cauterization. Endoscopic respiratory tract snares are used mainly for electrosurgical removal of polyps, tumors, and other abnormal tissue from the respiratory tract, but mechanical (cold) resection may be used for small polyps."}

Upon topical application, menthol acts on the cold-sensitive transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TMPR8), which provides a cooling sensation. This treatment also provides an analgesic effect through the activation of the inhibitory group II/III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). This may decrease neuropathic pain from chemotherapy. In addition, the topical application of menthol causes vasodilation.

Most commonly injured tendons and ligaments: supraspinatus tendon and long head of the biceps muscle; Medial and lateral extensors of the elbow; patellar tendon; Achilles tendon; posterior tibialis tendon. Intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors: overuse (sports activities, training errors, fatigue); cold environment during outdoor training; faulty footwear/equipment; drugs (e.g., fluoroquinolone antibiotics, oral contraceptives, injected corticosteroids and statins). Commonly described presenting symptoms: pain at the site of the affected tendon or ligament; morning stiffness, local tenderness, swelling and reduced articular range of motion. Therapeutic approaches include: exercise, shock wave therapy, growth factors, nitric oxide, sclerosant therapy, gene therapy, and tissue engineering."}

Upon local administration of the SR MMC hydrogel formulation to the upper urinary tract via a ureteral catheter, the gel solidifies and deposits MMC locally to prevent the excretion of this chemotherapeutic agent via urinary flow. In turn, MMC alkylates DNA, and produces interstrand DNA cross-links, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Due to its reverse thermal-gelation properties, this gel is able to stay in a liquid state at cold temperatures and solidifies at body temperature. This allows for increased accumulation of MMC locally in the upper urinary tract which leads to increased efficacy compared to standard intravesical delivery of MMC for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).

{"concept_id": "C4735572", "aliases": [], "types": ["T061"], "canonical_name": "Non-Drug Pain Management", "definition": "<h3>What is pain?</h3> <p><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pain.html\">Pain</a> is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Pain may be sharp or dull. It may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/backpain.html\">back</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/abdominalpain.html\">abdomen</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/chestpain.html\">chest</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pelvicpain.html\">pelvis</a>, or you may feel pain all over.</p> <p>There are two types of pain:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Acute pain</strong> usually comes on suddenly, because of a disease, injury, or inflammation. It can often be diagnosed and treated. It usually goes away, though sometimes it can turn into <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/chronicpain.html\">chronic pain</a>.</li> <li><strong>Chronic pain</strong> lasts for a long time, and can cause severe problems</li> </ul> <h3>What are pain relievers?</h3> <p><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html\">Pain relievers</a> are medicines that reduce or relieve pain. There are many different pain medicines, and each one has advantages and risks. Some are <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/overthecountermedicines.html\">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) medicines. Others are stronger medicines, which are available by prescription. The most powerful prescription pain relievers are opioids. They are very effective, but people who take them are at risk of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/opioidmisuseandaddiction.html\">addiction</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/opioidoverdose.html\">overdose</a>.</p> <p>Because of the side effects and risks of pain relievers, you may want to try non-drug treatments first. And if you do need to take medicines, also doing some non-drug treatments may allow you to take a lower dose.</p> <h3>What are some non-drug treatments for pain?</h3> <p>There are many non-drug treatments that can help with pain. It is important to check with your health care provider before trying any of them:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Acupuncture</strong> involves stimulating acupuncture points. These are specific points on your body. There are different acupuncture methods. The most common one involves inserting thin needles through the skin. Others include using pressure, electrical stimulation, and heat. Acupuncture is based on the belief that qi (vital energy) flows through the body along paths, called meridians. Practitioners believe that stimulating the acupuncture points can rebalance the qi. Research suggests that acupuncture can help manage certain pain conditions.</li> <li><strong>Biofeedback techniques</strong> use electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate. This teaches you to be more aware of your body functions so you can learn to control them. For example, a biofeedback device may show you measurements of your muscle tension. By watching how these measurements change, you can become more aware of when your muscles are tense and learn to relax them. Biofeedback may help to control pain, including chronic headaches and back pain.</li> <li><strong>Electrical stimulation</strong> involves using a device to send a gentle electric current to your nerves or muscles. This can help treat pain by interrupting or blocking the pain signals. Types include</li> <ul> <li>Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS)</li> <li>Implanted electric nerve stimulation</li> <li>Deep brain or spinal cord stimulation</li> </ul> <li><strong>Massage therapy</strong> is a treatment in which the soft tissues of the body are kneaded, rubbed, tapped, and stroked. Among other benefits, it may help people relax, and relieve stress and pain.</li> <li><strong>Meditation</strong> is a mind-body practice in which you focus your attention on something, such as an object, word, phrase, or breathing. This helps you to minimize distracting or stressful thoughts or feelings.</li> <li><strong>Physical therapy</strong> uses techniques such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation. It can help to control pain, as well as condition muscles and restore strength.</li> <li><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> (talk therapy) uses methods such as discussion, listening, and counseling to treat mental and behavioral disorders. It can also help people who have pain, especially chronic pain, by</li> <ul> <li>Teaching them coping skills, to be able to better deal with the stress that pain can cause</li> <li>Addressing negative thoughts and emotions that can make pain worse</li> <li>Providing them with support</li> </ul> <li><strong>Relaxation therapy</strong> can help reduce muscle tension and stress, lower blood pressure, and control pain. It may involve tensing and relaxing muscles throughout the body. It may be used with guided imagery (focusing the mind on positive images) and meditation.</li> <li><strong>Surgery</strong> can sometimes be necessary to treat severe pain, especially when it is caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries. There are always risks to getting surgery, and it does not always work to treat pain. So it is important to go through all of the risks and benefits with your health care provider.</li> </ul>"}

Upon intravesical instillation of the SR MMC hydrogel formulation UGN-102, the liquid converts into gel form and conforms to the bladder wall, allowing MMC to be deposited locally in the bladder to prevent the excretion of this chemotherapeutic agent via urinary flow. In turn, MMC alkylates DNA, and produces interstrand DNA cross-links, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis resulting in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Due to its reverse thermal-gelation properties, this gel is able to stay in a liquid state at cold temperatures, at 4 degrees Celsius, and transition to a water-soluble gel at body temperature. This allows for increased accumulation of MMC locally in the upper urinary tract which leads to increased efficacy compared to standard intravesical delivery of MMC for bladder cancer.

Upon local administration of the SR MMC hydrogel formulation to the upper urinary tract via a ureteral catheter, the gel solidifies and deposits MMC locally to prevent the excretion of this chemotherapeutic agent via urinary flow. In turn, MMC alkylates DNA, and produces interstrand DNA cross-links, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Due to its reverse thermal-gelation properties, this gel is able to stay in a liquid state at cold temperatures and solidifies at body temperature. This allows for increased accumulation of MMC locally in the upper urinary tract which leads to increased efficacy compared to standard intravesical delivery of MMC for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC)."}
